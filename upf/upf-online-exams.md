# Protocol for online exams

Exams will be conducted online, and you will need two devices: a PC/laptop (simply "laptop" in the following), and a second device with a camera, which can be a mobile/tablet/laptop (simply "mobile" in the following).

* The laptop will be for reading and answering the questions through Google Forms.
* The mobile will be for remote proctoring through Google Meet.

## Before the exam

### In your laptop: run the exam simulation

:warning: **Please test this [exam simulation to test your setup](https://forms.gle/RtNYyW4xvuZYNtYT9) in your laptop.**
You will need to find your a way of taking a photo and upload it to the Google Form.
Notice that in this form photos are limited to 1MB per photo. Search online for
how to reduce photo size in [Android](https://www.google.com/search?q=android+reduce+photo+size) or [iPhone](https://www.google.com/search?q=android+reduce+photo+size).
You can also take the photo with the camera of your laptop, if you know how to do that. Just make sure it is clear.

Please make sure your photo is recorded properly by looking at [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwFtLnctJqRhp1QgJ6yo4t8cMlblvYZ4MoZ_79Oxdeo/edit#). 
You should see clearly the image you uploaded. 

It is your responsibility to test this before the exam. If you cannot take a photo during the exam, you will have zero points in the questions that required a photo.

### In your mobile: test Google Meet

Please make sure you can use [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/)

## Before the exam starts

### Arrive early

The class will be divided into groups, each of them supervised by a different person. You will receive the link to Google Meet for your particular group before the exam.

Please arrive 15 minutes before the exam stars.

### Please have with you

* Your ID card.
* Your laptop for answering the Google Form.
* Your mobile for remote proctoring using Google Meet.
* A calculator, which we may use in some exams.
* A few sheets (~10) of white paper with nothing written or drawn on it.
* A pen, ideally black or of a dark color that marks well.

### Plug your devices and position your mobile

Make sure your devices will not run out of battery. Consider keeping them plugged.

Ensure your mobile is positioned it **to show the space of the table where you will be solving the exam, the laptop screen, and you**. You must keep, at all times, the video conference on the phone with a correct camera position.

## During the exam

### Open the exam

You will receive through Aula Global a link to a Google Form to answer the exam.

:pencil: You should save your answers often, in case your computer crashes. You can click *submit* as many times as you want, and come back to editing your answers. All answers can be edited multiple times until the deadline, except the ones that are answered with a photo.

:warning: For questions that are answered with a photo, prepare your answer on paper in a readable manner but **do not upload it** until 10 minutes before the deadline. The reason is (a) those answers cannot be modified, and (b) you may need to use your mobile.

Please write readable, short, clear answers and go straight to the point of what you have been asked. When asked for an algorithm, pseudocode is the best. Written descriptions tend to be ambiguous which makes them poor answers.

### While the exam proceeds

The screen of your laptop must show, at all times, the exam only. **The microphone must be ON at all times.** You will not be recorded during the exam.

**The speaker must be as LOW as possible,** but note you will need to listen to the professor.

Asking questions: You will raise your hand (physically, not using the app) and wait for the turn to speak. The questions will be public for everyone.

## Taking photos (for answers that require a photo) and delivering

:warning: 10 minutes before the deadline, please upload the answer to the questions that are answered with a photo, and submit.

# In case of doubt

In the case that the professor has any doubt that, for anyone, the exam was carried out without guarantees, the exam for this person will be void, and the evaluation will be carried out orally.
