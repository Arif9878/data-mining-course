# Practicum

## Practice sessions

Practice sessions are conducted in a computer lab and, as a general rule, are delivered individually within 24 hours of the end of the session.

There are 09 practice sessions in this course. Notebooks for each session start with *psNN* and describe the activities that the students must perform during the practice session.

Look for [**CODE**] and [**REPORT**] parts in those notebooks, and the "Deliver" section. Please ask in the course forum or to your teaching assistant ("*profesor/a de prácticas*") any questions you may have.

:bulb: **Read the practice descriptions before the session,** as they can be sometimes long. You can start working on these at any point, but they are not definitive until the end of the session; details may change.

| Session                               | Contents |

| [PS03](ps03_near_duplicates.ipynb)    | Near-duplicate detection |
| [PS04](ps04_association_rules.ipynb)  | Association rules mining |
| [PS07](ps07_outlier_analysis.ipynb)   | Outlier analysis |
| [PS08](ps08_data_streams.ipynb)       | Data streams |

## Assignments

Assignments, as a general rule, are done in pairs and in your own time. There is, however, a lab session dedicated to the assignment, usually but not always close to the delivery date, in which the teaching assistant (*profesor/a de prácticas*) will answer any questions you may have. Feel free to also post questions in the course forum.

There are 3 assignments in this course. Assignment descriptions start with "asNN".
